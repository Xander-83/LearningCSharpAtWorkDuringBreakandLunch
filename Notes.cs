             Constructors - Special type of method to create a object. Advantages can initial values when initial.
            Finalizer - is opposite of constructors
            Properties - Allows to get and set variables. 3 types Read & write, Read only and Write Only

            Interfaces is a group of related functions that any class or struct that implements the interface must implement.

            INTERFACES VS ABSTRACT CLASSES
            Absract class is used when we need any implementations of the same kind that use common behavior and interfaces is used when we want 
            multiple inheritances.

            INTERFACES
            -Does not implement methods
            -Workaround to multiple inhertiance
            -Can't contain constructors
            -All Members are public
            -Slower
            -Need to be fully implemented

            ABSTRACT CLASSES
            -Contains both declaration and definition
            -Can only have one abstract base class per child class
            -Contain constructors
            -Can't contain static members
            -Can include different access modifiers
            -Faster
            -Can be fully, partially, or not implemental at all

            IEnumerable - used in order to use a foreach loop to iterate over our collection
            public abstract void example(){} <- Abstract method declaration

            IEqualityComparer & IEquatable interface to determine if objects are equal
            IComparable & IComparer interface allow us to order, compare, and sort objects
            Virtual Method is a Abstract Method
            INotifyPropertyChanged notifies us that a property value has been modified
